## Introduction

<img src="img/logo.png" width="400">

Welcome to the PyFarm documentation! Pyfarm is an open source farm management
system created and maintained by
[Kevin Williams](https://github.com/KTech-Kevin) and
[KTech Industries](https://www.ktech.industries/).

PyFarm consists of multiple components including a web app, web api, and various
devices that can be used on their own, or in conjuction with the API.

Both the API and web app are designed in such a way that they can run on a
Raspberry Pi, but they will also work on a larger server or cloud environment.
