# Introduction

Welcome to the PyFarm documentation! Pyfarm is an open source farm management
system created and maintained by
[Kevin Williams](https://github.com/KTech-Kevin) and
[KTech Industries](https://www.ktech.industries/).

PyFarm consists of two distinct pieces:

1. A web application used for farm management. This application has both an api
   built with Python / Flask, and a frontend built with Javascript / React
2. Devices, which can be used independently, or in conjunction with
   the web app.

The web application is designed in such a way that it can run on a
Raspberry Pi, but will also work on a larger server or cloud environment.
