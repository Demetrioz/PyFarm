# First Login

After completing the [getting started](/docs/getting_started/app) steps, the
next task is to login to PyFarm.

Navigate to the url of your new PyFarm instance and log in with the following
information:

**Username**: Administrator  
**Password**: Admin1234

After logging in, you will be promted to change the Administrator password. It's
also recommended to create a new user, rather than continuing to use the
Administrator account.
